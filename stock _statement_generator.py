'''
Problem Motivation:
I will be coding up a transaction statement generator for traders on a stock trading system. The inputs are provided below, and the exact output you are to generate is provided after the inputs.

actions: the timestamped actions that the stock trader performed, it can be BUY or SELL type, and they can
buy or sell a few different stocks. However, you should assume that the number of ticker is not limited to
3 types as in the example below, but potentially infinite, so the ticker should not be hardcoded anywhere.

stock_actions: the timestamped actions that the stock performed regardless of who the trader is. It includes
stock splits, and dividend payouts. Even though these actions are not performed by our trader, it still affects
our trader's portfolios, so it should be recorded in the statement that we prepare.

* Note for Yixin:
Need a container for each date (key)
	inside each date container should keep track of 
		.# shares for each stock + price and dividend income -> portfolio container
		transaction history (stock splits, and dividend payouts) -> transaction history container

# Pseudo code
initializing the new container called statement <date (key): [{portfolio}, {transcation history}]>
statement = {}
portfolio = {}

step 1: combine two list based on their time stamp

one pass through the combined list and update portfolio {} and transaction {} accordingly, insert the updated snapshots of portfolio and transaction in statement AT THE END OF THE DAY with date (excluding time) as key

print out the statement container using the output formatt given

* Note:
actions have specific timestamp assuming multiple actions can happen during the same day
storck_actions have only general date, thus assuming heppens at the beginning of each day
